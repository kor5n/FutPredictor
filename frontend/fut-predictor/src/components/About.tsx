                Hi! I am Kor5n and this is my small project about EAFC(formerly known as FIFA).
                Here I have gathered all data about statistics of the footballers in the game and made a
                 machine that calculates your rating based on the stats you provided and the position you selected. <br /> <br />

                <b>Predict</b> link goes to the predicting machine <br /> <br />

                <b>Ratings</b> link goes to the data that I have gathered from <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/ratings">EAFC's website</a> <br /> <br />

                And the link to the <a href="https://github.com/kor5n/FutPredictor">github page</a> <br /> <br />

                Enjoy!
            </p>
